# Boost Your Efficiency - 4 Must-Have TailwindCSS VSCode Extensions

Are you using Visual Studio Code and Tailwind? Check out x extensions to boost your productivity

## Tailwind CSS IntelliSense

Download: [Visual Studio Marketplace - Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)

Tailwind CSS IntelliSense is my favorite extension and it brings three major features to your Visual Studio Code.

{% endfigure %}

### Autocomplete

Intelligent suggestions for class names, as well as CSS functions and directives.

### Linting

Additionally, Tailwind CSS IntelliSense highlights errors and potential bugs in both your CSS and your markup. This includes any duplicate classes in your code as well as missing classes in your Tailwind CSS theme.

### Hover Preview

Hover Preview allows you to see the complete CSS for a Tailwind class name by hovering over it. This subtle tooltip is helpful when you're debugging or just want to learn more about the CSS rules applied by different classes.

## Headwind

Download: [Visual Studio Marketplace - Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind)

Headwind provides an opinionated Tailwind CSS class sorter for Visual Studio Code. It enforces consistent ordering of classes by parsing your code and reprinting class tags to follow a given order. The consistent ordering provided by this extension allows you to naviagte through your code faster and keeps your codebase organized and easy to read.

## Tailwind Documentation

Download: [Visual Studio Marketplace - Tailwind Documentation](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alfredbirk.tailwind-documentation)

The Tailwind Documentation extension provides quick access to the official Tailwind CSS documentation directly within Visual Studio Code. Quick access to the documentation without the need of another browser window allows you to focus on what's important. Your code.

## Tailwind Fold

Download: [Visual Studio Marketplace - Tailwind Fold](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=stivo.tailwind-fold)

Tailwind Fold folds the, sometimes exhaustive, list of classes which heavily improves readability of your HTML code. Personally, I recommend checking out hte customization options of this extension. I don't like the default behavior of automatic folding, but instead use it sparingly when I'm looking at the HTML structure.

Curious how Tailwind Fold can improve your code? Check out the comparison below:
